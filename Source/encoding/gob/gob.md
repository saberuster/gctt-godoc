## package gob

  `import "encoding/gob"`

## Overview

Package gob manages streams of gobs - binary values exchanged between an Encoder
(transmitter) and a Decoder (receiver). A typical use is transporting arguments
and results of remote procedure calls (RPCs) such as those provided by package
"net/rpc".

The implementation compiles a custom codec for each data type in the stream and
is most efficient when a single Encoder is used to transmit a stream of values,
amortizing the cost of compilation.


Basics

A stream of gobs is self-describing. Each data item in the stream is preceded by
a specification of its type, expressed in terms of a small set of predefined
types. Pointers are not transmitted, but the things they point to are
transmitted; that is, the values are flattened. Nil pointers are not permitted,
as they have no value. Recursive types work fine, but recursive values (data
with cycles) are problematic. This may change.

To use gobs, create an Encoder and present it with a series of data items as
values or addresses that can be dereferenced to values. The Encoder makes sure
all type information is sent before it is needed. At the receive side, a Decoder
retrieves values from the encoded stream and unpacks them into local variables.


Types and Values

The source and destination values/types need not correspond exactly. For
structs, fields (identified by name) that are in the source but absent from the
receiving variable will be ignored. Fields that are in the receiving variable
but missing from the transmitted type or value will be ignored in the
destination. If a field with the same name is present in both, their types must
be compatible. Both the receiver and transmitter will do all necessary
indirection and dereferencing to convert between gobs and actual Go values. For
instance, a gob type that is schematically,

    struct { A, B int }

can be sent from or received into any of these Go types:

    struct { A, B int }	// the same
    *struct { A, B int }	// extra indirection of the struct
    struct { *A, **B int }	// extra indirection of the fields
    struct { A, B int64 }	// different concrete value type; see below

It may also be received into any of these:

    struct { A, B int }	// the same
    struct { B, A int }	// ordering doesn't matter; matching is by name
    struct { A, B, C int }	// extra field (C) ignored
    struct { B int }	// missing field (A) ignored; data will be dropped
    struct { B, C int }	// missing field (A) ignored; extra field (C) ignored.

Attempting to receive into these types will draw a decode error:

    struct { A int; B uint }	// change of signedness for B
    struct { A int; B float }	// change of type for B
    struct { }			// no field names in common
    struct { C, D int }		// no field names in common

Integers are transmitted two ways: arbitrary precision signed integers or
arbitrary precision unsigned integers. There is no int8, int16 etc.
discrimination in the gob format; there are only signed and unsigned integers.
As described below, the transmitter sends the value in a variable-length
encoding; the receiver accepts the value and stores it in the destination
variable. Floating-point numbers are always sent using IEEE-754 64-bit precision
(see below).

Signed integers may be received into any signed integer variable: int, int16,
etc.; unsigned integers may be received into any unsigned integer variable; and
floating point values may be received into any floating point variable. However,
the destination variable must be able to represent the value or the decode
operation will fail.

Structs, arrays and slices are also supported. Structs encode and decode only
exported fields. Strings and arrays of bytes are supported with a special,
efficient representation (see below). When a slice is decoded, if the existing
slice has capacity the slice will be extended in place; if not, a new array is
allocated. Regardless, the length of the resulting slice reports the number of
elements decoded.

In general, if allocation is required, the decoder will allocate memory. If not,
it will update the destination variables with values read from the stream. It
does not initialize them first, so if the destination is a compound value such
as a map, struct, or slice, the decoded values will be merged elementwise into
the existing variables.

Functions and channels will not be sent in a gob. Attempting to encode such a
value at the top level will fail. A struct field of chan or func type is treated
exactly like an unexported field and is ignored.

Gob can encode a value of any type implementing the GobEncoder or
encoding.BinaryMarshaler interfaces by calling the corresponding method, in that
order of preference.

Gob can decode a value of any type implementing the GobDecoder or
encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler interfaces by calling the corresponding method, again
in that order of preference.


Encoding Details

This section documents the encoding, details that are not important for most
users. Details are presented bottom-up.

An unsigned integer is sent one of two ways. If it is less than 128, it is sent
as a byte with that value. Otherwise it is sent as a minimal-length big-endian
(high byte first) byte stream holding the value, preceded by one byte holding
the byte count, negated. Thus 0 is transmitted as (00), 7 is transmitted as (07)
and 256 is transmitted as (FE 01 00).

A boolean is encoded within an unsigned integer: 0 for false, 1 for true.

A signed integer, i, is encoded within an unsigned integer, u. Within u, bits 1
upward contain the value; bit 0 says whether they should be complemented upon
receipt. The encode algorithm looks like this:

    var u uint
    if i < 0 {
    	u = (^uint(i) << 1) | 1 // complement i, bit 0 is 1
    } else {
    	u = (uint(i) << 1) // do not complement i, bit 0 is 0
    }
    encodeUnsigned(u)

The low bit is therefore analogous to a sign bit, but making it the complement
bit instead guarantees that the largest negative integer is not a special case.
For example, -129=^128=(^256>>1) encodes as (FE 01 01).

Floating-point numbers are always sent as a representation of a float64 value.
That value is converted to a uint64 using math.Float64bits. The uint64 is then
byte-reversed and sent as a regular unsigned integer. The byte-reversal means
the exponent and high-precision part of the mantissa go first. Since the low
bits are often zero, this can save encoding bytes. For instance, 17.0 is encoded
in only three bytes (FE 31 40).

Strings and slices of bytes are sent as an unsigned count followed by that many
uninterpreted bytes of the value.

All other slices and arrays are sent as an unsigned count followed by that many
elements using the standard gob encoding for their type, recursively.

Maps are sent as an unsigned count followed by that many key, element pairs.
Empty but non-nil maps are sent, so if the receiver has not allocated one
already, one will always be allocated on receipt unless the transmitted map is
nil and not at the top level.

In slices and arrays, as well as maps, all elements, even zero-valued elements,
are transmitted, even if all the elements are zero.

Structs are sent as a sequence of (field number, field value) pairs. The field
value is sent using the standard gob encoding for its type, recursively. If a
field has the zero value for its type (except for arrays; see above), it is
omitted from the transmission. The field number is defined by the type of the
encoded struct: the first field of the encoded type is field 0, the second is
field 1, etc. When encoding a value, the field numbers are delta encoded for
efficiency and the fields are always sent in order of increasing field number;
the deltas are therefore unsigned. The initialization for the delta encoding
sets the field number to -1, so an unsigned integer field 0 with value 7 is
transmitted as unsigned delta = 1, unsigned value = 7 or (01 07). Finally, after
all the fields have been sent a terminating mark denotes the end of the struct.
That mark is a delta=0 value, which has representation (00).

Interface types are not checked for compatibility; all interface types are
treated, for transmission, as members of a single "interface" type, analogous to
int or []byte - in effect they're all treated as interface{}. Interface values
are transmitted as a string identifying the concrete type being sent (a name
that must be pre-defined by calling Register), followed by a byte count of the
length of the following data (so the value can be skipped if it cannot be
stored), followed by the usual encoding of concrete (dynamic) value stored in
the interface value. (A nil interface value is identified by the empty string
and transmits no value.) Upon receipt, the decoder verifies that the unpacked
concrete item satisfies the interface of the receiving variable.

If a value is passed to Encode and the type is not a struct (or pointer to
struct, etc.), for simplicity of processing it is represented as a struct of one
field. The only visible effect of this is to encode a zero byte after the value,
just as after the last field of an encoded struct, so that the decode algorithm
knows when the top-level value is complete.

The representation of types is described below. When a type is defined on a
given connection between an Encoder and Decoder, it is assigned a signed integer
type id. When Encoder.Encode(v) is called, it makes sure there is an id assigned
for the type of v and all its elements and then it sends the pair (typeid,
encoded-v) where typeid is the type id of the encoded type of v and encoded-v is
the gob encoding of the value v.

To define a type, the encoder chooses an unused, positive type id and sends the
pair (-type id, encoded-type) where encoded-type is the gob encoding of a
wireType description, constructed from these types:

    type wireType struct {
    	ArrayT  *ArrayType
    	SliceT  *SliceType
    	StructT *StructType
    	MapT    *MapType
    }
    type arrayType struct {
    	CommonType
    	Elem typeId
    	Len  int
    }
    type CommonType struct {
    	Name string // the name of the struct type
    	Id  int    // the id of the type, repeated so it's inside the type
    }
    type sliceType struct {
    	CommonType
    	Elem typeId
    }
    type structType struct {
    	CommonType
    	Field []*fieldType // the fields of the struct.
    }
    type fieldType struct {
    	Name string // the name of the field.
    	Id   int    // the type id of the field, which must be already defined
    }
    type mapType struct {
    	CommonType
    	Key  typeId
    	Elem typeId
    }

If there are nested type ids, the types for all inner type ids must be defined
before the top-level type id is used to describe an encoded-v.

For simplicity in setup, the connection is defined to understand these types a
priori, as well as the basic gob types int, uint, etc. Their ids are:

    bool        1
    int         2
    uint        3
    float       4
    []byte      5
    string      6
    complex     7
    interface   8
    // gap for reserved ids.
    WireType    16
    ArrayType   17
    CommonType  18
    SliceType   19
    StructType  20
    FieldType   21
    // 22 is slice of fieldType.
    MapType     23

Finally, each message created by a call to Encode is preceded by an encoded
unsigned integer count of the number of bytes remaining in the message. After
the initial type name, interface values are wrapped the same way; in effect, the
interface value acts like a recursive invocation of Encode.

In summary, a gob stream looks like

    (byteCount (-type id, encoding of a wireType)* (type id, encoding of a value))*

where * signifies zero or more repetitions and the type id of a value must be
predefined or be defined before the value in the stream.

Compatibility: Any future changes to the package will endeavor to maintain
compatibility with streams encoded using previous versions. That is, any
released version of this package should be able to decode data written with any
previously released version, subject to issues such as security fixes. See the
Go compatibility document for background: https://golang.org/doc/go1compat

    <a href="#Register">¶</a></h2>
<pre>func Register(value interface{})</pre>

Register records a type, identified by a value for that type, under its internal
type name. That name will identify the concrete type of a value sent or received
as an interface variable. Only types that will be transferred as implementations
of interface values need to be registered. Expecting to be used only during
initialization, it panics if the mapping between types and names is not a
bijection.

<h2 id="RegisterName">func <a href="//github.com/golang/go/blob/2ea7d3461bb41d0ae12b56ee52d43314bcdb97f9/src/encoding/gob/type.go#L797">RegisterName</a>
    <a href="#RegisterName">¶</a></h2>
<pre>func RegisterName(name <a href="/builtin/#string">string</a>, value interface{})</pre>

RegisterName is like Register but uses the provided name rather than the type's
default.

<h2 id="CommonType">type <a href="//github.com/golang/go/blob/2ea7d3461bb41d0ae12b56ee52d43314bcdb97f9/src/encoding/gob/type.go#L206">CommonType</a>

<pre>type CommonType struct {
<span id="CommonType.Name"></span>    Name <a href="/builtin/#string">string</a>
<span id="CommonType.Id"></span>    Id   typeId
}</pre>

CommonType holds elements of all types. It is a historical artifact, kept for
binary compatibility and exported only for the benefit of the package's encoding
of type descriptors. It is not intended for direct use by clients.

<h2 id="Decoder">type <a href="//github.com/golang/go/blob/2ea7d3461bb41d0ae12b56ee52d43314bcdb97f9/src/encoding/gob/decoder.go#L16">Decoder</a>
    <a href="#Decoder">¶</a></h2>
<pre>type Decoder struct {
    <span class="comment">// contains filtered or unexported fields</span>
}</pre>

A Decoder manages the receipt of type and data information read from the remote
side of a connection.

The Decoder does only basic sanity checking on decoded input sizes, and its
limits are not configurable. Take caution when decoding gob data from untrusted
sources.

<h3 id="NewDecoder">func <a href="//github.com/golang/go/blob/2ea7d3461bb41d0ae12b56ee52d43314bcdb97f9/src/encoding/gob/decoder.go#L31">NewDecoder</a>
    <a href="#NewDecoder">¶</a></h3>
<pre>func NewDecoder(r <a href="/io/">io</a>.<a href="/io/#Reader">Reader</a>) *<a href="#Decoder">Decoder</a></pre>

NewDecoder returns a new decoder that reads from the io.Reader. If r does not
also implement io.ByteReader, it will be wrapped in a bufio.Reader.

<h3 id="Decoder.Decode">func (*Decoder) <a href="//github.com/golang/go/blob/2ea7d3461bb41d0ae12b56ee52d43314bcdb97f9/src/encoding/gob/decoder.go#L166">Decode</a>
    <a href="#Decoder.Decode">¶</a></h3>
<pre>func (dec *<a href="#Decoder">Decoder</a>) Decode(e interface{}) <a href="/builtin/#error">error</a></pre>

Decode reads the next value from the input stream and stores it in the data
represented by the empty interface value. If e is nil, the value will be
discarded. Otherwise, the value underlying e must be a pointer to the correct
type for the next data item received. If the input is at EOF, Decode returns
io.EOF and does not modify e.

<pre>func (dec *<a href="#Decoder">Decoder</a>) DecodeValue(v <a href="/reflect/">reflect</a>.<a href="/reflect/#Value">Value</a>) <a href="/builtin/#error">error</a></pre>

DecodeValue reads the next value from the input stream. If v is the zero
reflect.Value (v.Kind() == Invalid), DecodeValue discards the value. Otherwise,
it stores the value into v. In that case, v must represent a non-nil pointer to
data or be an assignable reflect.Value (v.CanSet()) If the input is at EOF,
DecodeValue returns io.EOF and does not modify v.

An Encoder manages the transmission of type and data information to the other
side of a connection.

<pre>func NewEncoder(w <a href="/io/">io</a>.<a href="/io/#Writer">Writer</a>) *<a href="#Encoder">Encoder</a></pre>

NewEncoder returns a new encoder that will transmit on the io.Writer.

Encode transmits the data item represented by the empty interface value,
guaranteeing that all necessary type information has been transmitted first.
Passing a nil pointer to Encoder will panic, as they cannot be transmitted by
gob.

GobDecoder is the interface describing data that provides its own routine for
decoding transmitted values sent by a GobEncoder.

    GobEncode() ([]<a href="/builtin/#byte">byte</a>, <a href="/builtin/#error">error</a>)
}</pre>

GobEncoder is the interface describing data that provides its own representation
for encoding values for transmission to a GobDecoder. A type that implements
GobEncoder and GobDecoder has complete control over the representation of its
data and may therefore contain things such as private fields, channels, and
functions, which are not usually transmissible in gob streams.

Note: Since gobs can be stored permanently, it is good design to guarantee the
encoding used by a GobEncoder is stable as the software evolves. For instance,
it might make sense for GobEncode to include a version number in the encoding.
